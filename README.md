# MyApplication
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

  - Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
  - Creating new activities
  - Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app.
  - Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
